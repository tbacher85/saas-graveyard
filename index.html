            <h3>Example Failed Project: "FlowMetrics"</h3>
            <p><strong>Cause of Death:</strong> No market need</p>
            <p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> We built a complex analytics dashboard for a niche that just wanted simple reports. We didn't talk to customers early enough.</p>

            <h3>Example Failed Project: "PostPerfect"</h3>
            <p><strong>Cause of Death:</strong> Ran out of money</p>
            <p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> Bootstrapping was tough. Our customer acquisition cost was higher than our lifetime value. We should have focused on a cheaper channel.</p>
